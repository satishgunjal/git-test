Let's talk about money. Money is one of the
world's oldest products, has been around for
over 3000 years. For most of this time, money came in the
form of an analog object such as a shell, a coin or a piece of paper. Money was also one of the first products
to become digitized. For example, as far
back as the 1970s, firms began to pay employees the direct deposits rather
than physical checks, and online banking began
in the early 1980s. Since then, there's been several other
digital innovations, such as the development of
electronic currencies like Bitcoin and mobile payment
on your smartphone. In countries such as Singapore, France and the Netherlands, over half of transactions
are now totally cashless. Why has money been so easy
to digitize in so many ways? To help answer that question, we're here at the University of Illinois
Community Credit Union. Now, this establishment has three locations here in
the Champaign Urbana area, one on the U of I campus
in the Illinois union, one in Urbana and one
here in Champaign. This union serves the faculty, students and staff of
the U of I community, has about 50,000 members. I'm here to speak
with my friend E.J. Downey. E.J. is the CEO and president of the U of
I Community Credit Union. When I asked him about
this digitization process and learn more about
the credit union. Well, follow me inside. Let's see if we can
locate E.J. E.J. Yeah publisher. Great thanks for meeting today. Well, my pleasure. Got some time to chat? Yes we do. You tell us a bit about the U
of I Community Credit Union and what you do as the
president and CEO? U of I credit union is like 6200 credit unions
in the United States, we're not for profit,
financial cooperatives. The members are the
owners just like a food cooperative or a
cooperative you find in Europe. We're about 300 million
in assets and serve about 50,000 members that are on
campus or in community. My role as CEO is I report to a volunteer
board of directors. Since it's a cooperative,
we have nine directors. They spend about 200 hours a year helping to lead the
organization's strategy, the credit union strategy, and then they also
manage our policies, and then they delegate
operational responsibility to me. We have about 120 employees here, three locations, and our job
is really retail finance. We don't do any business lending. The average loan
that we do here is $13,000 and we help people
with their mortgages, their car loans, their credit
cards and their auto-loans. The back office
operations were able to handle account openings,
membership cards, financial statements, the
statements of the members were no longer sitting down and
having to print those out in mass and then put them
in an envelope herself. It's made back office much more efficient
and allowed us to move more employees to what we would call production areas
or front facing areas. Ten years ago, people said, well, what if I need to dispute something I don't
have any record of it? I think people are more
comfortable now than ever with the Cloud and sharing PDFs that they can more
readily go out and find what they need than
they could 10 years ago. That's really helped
them adopt more quickly. Security compliance, it's also been much more
efficient where we're able to stay ahead of the members that are
trying to commit fraud or hurt the credit union and steal money from
the other members. Ninety five percent of the paychecks that
come here in any form, whether it's total paycheck
or partial, is electronic. We still see checks when
people have a side business, maybe they are doing business as something
they're selling Avon products or pampered stuff or something of that nature. People still have a tendency
to cut a check rather than use a person
to person payment. But again, I think
that will continue to change over time. The PayPal is really on
the forefront of that. They've done an excellent job
of figuring out how to make people comfortable with
person to person payments. But paychecks, yes. Largely electronic, and people are comfortable
with that and almost all cases in the
institution's best interest to do it electronically
because you don't have to replace checks. You don't have to
worry about someone taking the check out of the
mail or out of the office. It just makes it safer
to have as an ACH, Automated Clearing House
electronic payment. We don't work with
PayPal or Bitcoin, but it's strategically for
us and for retail banks, the biggest strategic threats are Fintech, Financial tech, and that's the term
that my industry has been using for the last five, six years, is organizations that can come in and disrupt the
financial services industry. They don't have a
physical footprint. They can use existing
technology and they know that the future client
base testimonials are very used to and accustomed to doing things on their mobile devices, so they're really targeting that. That's where PayPal
has really excelled. We have our own providers. We have to be essentially
rapid adapters as PayPal rolls out
an innovation like a loadable card for
your children to use rather than give them cash
each week for their allowance. There are people that
are now giving them a card and they can move
money back and forth. We need to be able to adapt
with our business partners and saying what can we deploy
that will combat that? Enhancements to online banking, stronger protection
on your credit card, less fraud on having
your card compromised. One thing that it's
not a new technology. It's been out for a
while, but we plan to do more of it when they actually have a machine
that will instant issue a credit or debit card
here in our branches. That way if someone
comes into open account, you come from
University of Wisconsin down here to take a job
and you open your account, you have to wait 10 days
to get your credit card, and instead, we can
give that to you and turn it on the
day that you're here. Instant issue, which is
actually to the point of discourse with the
digital-analog age, we think we'd be moving away from physical plastic but it's still probably a decade
out before people are comfortable just
using Apple Pay. In fact, I was talking
to my colleague at Perdue Federal Credit
Union and they went down the route for the
last two years of really promoting a digital wallet
because they felt like members are really going to start using their phone and not using their plastic and they've completely
backed off that. They didn't have the
adoption rate and they went out and they
bought more machines for their branches in terms
of instant issue because people are still
using the plastic and still want to pull
it out of their wallet. We're not quite there
yet but I think for the students is that they'll
see more digital wallets. The FinTechs will
make that easier and make it more ubiquitous
in my opinion. There are credit unions
that have and banks that have no folks in their lobbies
so that they just do this. They have video conferencing where you walk in and you do talk to someone
in a call center, but they're just miles away in a central location
and they can do everything that you
need in terms of cash or issuing cards, etc but they do that
electronically through a video. Having someone 10 years ago use a Excel spreadsheet to log new account information
then submit it to the regulators where now the system does that automatically
and submits a daily, 10 years ago having an individual employee sit
there and look through every transaction
during the course of the day to see if any of those transactions
exceeded $10,000 in cash. If anyone withdrawals $10,000 in cash or more from a
financial institution, we have to report that
to the government. Ten years ago, we'd have to have an individual that would
have to look at it and then they would have to
cross-reference it with our other two branches and ATMs and make sure
that someone didn't remove 3,000 from one branch, 3,000 from a second, 3,000 from a third, and then 500 from an ATM, and in one day and then
that all exceeded. That had to be
largely looked at on a spreadsheet and sort
it now that's done automatically through
our core system. That's just one example of
things where we're trying to find the fraud or people that are trying to evade
the law intentionally. Server room is probably
a quarter of the size it was 10 years ago because we can do so
much more in the Cloud. We have a lot more redundancy
than we did before. We don't have the fear
that we're used to that if this location went down, that we couldn't be back up and running in no time
because we're able to create redundancy
with our core system and at other locations
using the cloud. A lot of different things
when I think about it. I hate to sound
like a politician, but the largest banks, the top 20 banks, the credit unions as an industry there are 60-200 credit unions like I mentioned at the start. We have one trillion in assets, about 1.1 trillion, and we
serve one-third of Americans. Bank of America has 2.5
trillion in assets. They're are two
-and-a-half times the size of my entire industry. The very largest banks and
financial institutions are benefiting from if they can
eliminate a transaction, if they can take a teller
transaction from 30 seconds to 20 seconds and then multiply that across thousands of branches,
that's significant savings. It's like a UPS model is that UPS tries to minimize how many left
turns or eliminate left turns that their
trucks take because it's inefficient
and if you multiply that across the number of trucks they have and drivers
that's significant savings. Again, a commodity model. We are not for profit but as we talk about
we're not for loss. The digitization of products has also brought us
closer to parity with the larger financial
institutions because we have to rapidly adapt and provide
the same services they do. To your question
about 20 minutes ago, what's around the horizon is it's pretty much whatever a
bank comes out with, one of the large banks,
we're going to try and mimic that and put it in place
as quickly as possible. It's leveled the playing field where a student that comes
in town and wants to open up a account here at
University of Illinois a credit Union can use that account
anywhere in the country, whereas before they
might just have their account up in Chicago,
wherever they're from. That's helped level
it but certainly, the efficiencies
for the large banks have allowed them to make far more money and really
dominate the industry. It's been a rapidly changing pace and it's been good and bad. I can't sit back and say that it's hurt the financial
services industry. I think it's been a big
benefit to the consumers. Yes, it's also made it easier
for them to get money. We have more people able
to move into a home or get a car or have
a credit card and that's not necessarily
a bad thing and then the ability to have your children linked
to your account and those things have
been very beneficial. That's like any technology
if it's used for good or bad you're going
to have that outcome. We're at uoficreditunion.org
or illinicard.org. Thank you so much. Thank you, sir. Great job. Based on what you just learned about the University of Illinois
Community Credit Union, I'd like you to answer
three questions. First of all, what
were the factors that made money so easy to digitize? Second, what other digital
innovations could help enhance the marketing and business of credit unions like the
University of Illinois? Third, and finally, what did this case teach you
about digital dominance? Well, I hope you enjoyed
this video case and that you learn something new about marketing in an analog world.
