# Course Description
This course is composed of two 4-week MOOCs: The Digital Marketing Revolution and Marketing in a Digital World.

## The Digital Marketing Revolution (the first 4 weeks)

The Digital Revolution is dramatically altered the way many products are created, promoted, distributed, and consumed. Before the advent of new digital technologies such as the Internet, personal computer and smartphone, marketing was largely an Analog (i.e., physical) activity. Today, many marketing activities such as how products are promoted are increasingly Digital in nature. However, we still live in an Analog (or physical) World. For example, even today, most sales are still conducted in physical stores. Thus, both marketers and consumers must simultaneously navigate both the Analog and Digital worlds on a daily basis. This course examines both the Analog and the Digital and how these two forces relate to one another within the Digital Marketing Revolution.

This course will begin with an exploration of the key differences between the Analog and the Digital and then examine four ways in which the Analog World has been affected by the Digital Revolution: Domination, Resistance, Synergy, and Transformation. This course will contain several examples of each of these concepts and explore their implications for both marketers and consumers. This course will also employ a variety of learning techniques, including video lectures, case studies, hands-on exercises, and interviews with leading marketing scholars. The learning approach will be highly interactive; you will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of hands-on activities and be a member of a rich learning community. I hope you will join us in this learning adventure.

## Marketing in a Digital World (the second 4 weeks)

This course offers a strategic perspective and examination on how the digital revolution is  changing the marketing landscape. We will explore this new digital realm and discuss its revolutionary impact upon both firms and consumers. We will examine a wide range of digital tools, introduce some new concepts, and share some stories about how firms and consumers are adapting to this changing landscape. Managers will learn how to use digital tools to strengthen their marketing efforts, while consumers will learn how to use these tools to enhance their consumption experience.

Our course will review the foundations of marketing (i.e., product, promotion, placement, and price) and discuss how these foundations are being shifted by the rise of the digital revolution. We'll employ a variety of learning techniques, including video lectures, hands-on exercises, and case studies. Our learning approach will be highly interactive; you will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of hands-on activities.

Please note that this is not an e-commerce class. We will not examine social media analytics, search engine optimization, or other digital marketing tactics. The other courses in our Digital Marketing Specialization will cover these topics in considerable detail. Instead, this course is broader in focus and more strategic in orientation.
