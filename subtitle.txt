[MUSIC] If you've been to a large
international airport recently, you've probably noticed that air travel
is increasingly becoming digital. For example,
many large international airports, digital kiosks locate your reservation,
print your boarding pass and luggage tags and may even try to sell
you upgrades such as a better seat. And after you check in, you can use an app on your smartphone
to access a digital boarding pass, check the status of your flight and
location over the boarding gate. And as you're waiting for your flight, you'll probably walk past
several digital billboards. It may even use your smartphone to buy
some wine for the duty free shop and have it delivered to your seat. We're here on this very windy day
in front of Willard Airport which is owned by the University of Illinois. Here in Champagne Illinois at present, only one airline flies in and
out of Willard. That's American airlines which has
a grand total of two destinations, Chicago and Dallas Texas. We're here to speak to Gene Casarez, Gene is the executive
director of Willard Airport. We're going to speak to him about
the airports operations and how you might find more
resistance to the digital. Here in a small town airport like Willard, you might find at a international
airport such as Chicago O'hare. Let's go inside and
see if we can find Gene, come along. [MUSIC] Hi, Gene. >> Hi Eric. >> Thanks for meeting with us today. >> Yeah, no problem. >> Got some time for a quick chat? >> Definitely, let's do. >> Okay, let's go. [MUSIC] Could you start by tell us
a bit about Willard Airport and your role as executive director? >> Okay, Willard Airport is like many
airports in communities this size. It's a what the FA classifies
as a primary non hub airport, were around 200,000 passengers a year
that come through Willard Airport. The majority of the customers that we have
flying to the airport are business related travelers either coming to the area
to do business with the university or one of the many other businesses
that are in the community. Or their professors or teachers or
researchers from the university or business members of the community who
are traveling out for their work. The university is the owner and operator
of the airport, which is a rare event. There's not very many commercial service
airports in the United States that are owned and operated by
an organization such as the university. I'm the executive director of the airport,
I've been at the airport for about a year and four months now. My role is to take over all
the business administration and operational administration of the airport. One of the biggest problems with marketing
the airport is we don't really sell anything. The airline sells the product and we're just the facilitator
of what they sell. The airline is an independent business
that comes in and out of the airport and we are essentially a landlord that
provides facilities for them. Those facilities are the terminal
building, parking all the way out to the ramps and the runways and taxiways
and everything they need to do their job. We don't want them driving to Chicago or
driving Indianapolis, we want them coming here and
flying in and out of here. So we're marketing to
the airlines themselves, trying to tell them about the community,
trying to tell them about the number of passengers we have that
they could draw from, trying to tell them about the businesses
that are here that will use them. So we're constantly before the airlines
marketing the community as well. So it's more than just
selling to the customer, it's also selling to the provider. Getting in and out of this airport is far easier than
trying to drive from here to Chicago, dealing with the traffic in Chicago,
paying the price of parking in Chicago, parking three miles away from the airport
and still having the bus to the airport. And then the hassle of the security,
getting your baggage checked, everything that you have to do. Here, it's almost like you just waltz in,
our parking is right in the front door, everything is premium parking. You come right in the front door, you talk right away with a customer
service agent with the airline. You check your bag, you get through
security in less than 10,15 minutes even on the most busy flight. And then you have the convenience
of waiting in a very small, comfortable airport. Very first off, you're going to see a lot
more of it at an airport like O'Hare for instance, we have an advertising
program in the building. One of the revenue sources that we
use is to try to sell advertising within the building. We've got enough passengers coming in and
out of the airport that we can market to the local community businesses
to put their information here so that the people traveling through
can know about the restaurants and the hotels and the car,
eight lots in town, those type of things. Historically, that's always
been very analog advertising. The other thing that you see on
the digital side is the ease of check in using kiosks,
having electronic boarding passes. Those things have been in the larger
airports for quite some time. And of course they're just now really
getting to be the mainstream in the smaller airports. The beauty of the smaller airports is
they're still small enough you can have the physical person checking you in,
taking care of things for you. When the airlines first moved
over to doing the kiosks and moving away from people,
there was a lot of kickback from that. The kickback was that the bigger airports,
but at the smaller airports it was very vocal,
people were upset about it. One of the things they would say is that
the reason they like flying to the small airport is the personal service and
somebody to help them right away. I think the biggest downside is when
everything is not working the way it's supposed to work. So if there's a delayed flight or
your flight got cancelled now, the problem is because the airlines have
moved away from having a large number of employees behind the counter ready to
help you immediately with any problem. Now there's less employees so
it takes much longer to solve a problem. It takes much longer to redirect or
reroute your flights, get you a new boarding pass printed,
whatever it might happen. So the downside is really when there's a
glitch in the system and unfortunately air travel is always going to be dependent on
things such as whether cancellations and delays in other areas. So there will always be times when you
have a problem with your air travel. Many of them recognize everybody, know
them by name, know the frequent flyers by name, chat with them on a regular basis,
you're not going to find that with the machine and you're
not going to find it at O'Hare either. So it's one of those things
that does make flying in and out of here extremely unique. The cost to put in an automated
system at an airport this size doesn't really meet up
with the benefit that you get. The local staff of the airline ground
handling people can still move the bags fast enough. That an automated system and airport this size really isn't
going to be beneficial to us. Well, obviously getting
on board the aircraft, having to fly the distance in
between point A and point B. The aircraft taking off and landing, all those things will always
be an analog physical event. Until we have that star
trek world where we're all being transported on light beams. It's not going to change that aspect
of it, where we will continue to see more digitalization is the processing
of the people through. Almost to the point where eventually
everything from the security process of the screening will start from
the time you leave your house, a screening process will start. They'll know that you're on your way,
they'll start running background checks on people who they need to
run background checks on. There will be different ways of looking
at vehicles as they get closer to the building, as you walk through
the building, there will be ways to monitor the people that are coming in and
out doing behavioral recognition. So even the security process will get more
digitalized as you go through to the point that eventually you'll just be
walking up towards the aircraft and all the scanning will
happen very unobtrusively. That's probably a long ways away, but
it's still moving in that direction. I think the biggest factor that drives
it is the airlines need to cut costs. So the investment up front of
digitalizing their systems and automating their systems makes for
long term cost cutting, which is mostly in
the realms of personnel. The biggest driver of automation and
baggage handling is efficiency. Less bags get lost, bags are there
on time, so the efficiency is really driving the baggage handling aspect
of this as far as the automation and digitalization of ticket sales,
boarding passes. That's one of those things that makes
it easier and less expensive for the customer to buy tickets and
get on board aircraft. So that becomes a marketing emphasis for
them because if it's easier for you to buy a ticket, get to the airport, get on
board than it ever has been in the past, you're more likely to travel via airline. I try to end most anything like this with
just an emphasis on the really the need. Small airports like this
have people to fly local. It's your local hometown airport, you need
to really support it as much as you can. It's a valuable asset to your community,
it's a valuable asset to your businesses. And if you want it to be successful,
you want it to be viable, you need to choose to buy tickets and
do your flying through your local airport. It's iflycu.com, we also have
a huge presence on Facebook and other social media. And that's one of the things
digitalized we want to use and take advantage of is those aspects of
getting out to people on social media.
